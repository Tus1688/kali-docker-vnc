easily build & run kali linux on docker while utilizing the power of vnc

![kali-docker-vnc](./kali-docker-vnc.png)

# Features:
The only persistent is `/home/kali`. Let's say you got pwned by malicious script, 
that successfully escalates to root and manages to create super sneaky persistence in `/root`, modifying `/etc/hosts`,
installing something in `/usr/bin`. Luckily, **It won't be happen here**, as everything except `/home/kali`
will be **disposed** following shutdown.
However, it's **still possible to add malicious hooks in `/home/kali`** for example `.zshrc` or `.profile`, which will be run everytime you open zsh, and surely
many others places.

# Important notes:
`kali_data` is docker volume that will be binded upon container creation, your customization will be kept there. If you think your `/home/kali` is compromised,
just delete `kali_data`.

# How to use:
1. `git clone https://github.com/Tus1688/kali-docker-vnc`
2. Create `package.txt`
3. Fill it with packages you want to install, for example:
```
tool1
tool2
tool3
````
4. Generate Dockerfile by running `python3 generate.py`
5. Build docker image by running `python3 build.py`
6. Run it, `python3 run.py` for cli only or `python3 vnc-run.py` to start with vnc and ssh
7. Profits ðŸ¤‘
8. If you use vnc then you can kill your container with `python3 kill-container.py`
